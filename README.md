# HbNB - The AirBnb Clone V 1.0

HBNB clone takes AirBnb original Web page and services for making a full functional Service, back-end and front-end are implemented from scratch following this structure:

## Getting started

* Lite Shell works on Unix-like systems but Linux distros are prefered

* Lite Shell is not distributed by any homebrew then for installing you must clone the repository and copy liteshell to /bin

Inside the repository execute:

```bash
cp liteshell /bin
```

## Usage

### Invocation

* in non interactive mode from SH:

```bash
SH> echo "input" | liteshell
SH> "input"
```

* In interactive mode:

```bash
SH> liteshell
lsh> echo "input"
lsh> "input"
```

* Going out interactive mode

```bash
lsh> exit
SH>
```

## Road Map

* [OK] A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* [__] A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* [OK] A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* [__] An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
